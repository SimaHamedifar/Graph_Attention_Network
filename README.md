# Graph_Attention_Network
The main purpose of this code is to learn the energy trading behaviour in a local energy trading community. To this end, a graph attention network with encoder and decoder components is built according to the article https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903. In addition, this model creates feature representation vectors of the nodes (prosumers/consumers) using the attention mechanism.
